1. Batch execute GEE Export task

Tired of click run button in the browser when exporting data?  
Tired of translate JavaScript into python, because of inconvenient batch exporting?  
Tired of paste JavaScript into console?  

Tampermonkey can solve those problems.
Here is a little script about tampermonkey, which is used to batch click run button and comfirm all the tasks in GEE (https://github.com/kongdd/GEE_Tools/blob/master/gee_monkey.js).

What your need is: chrome+Tampermonkey, and new Tampermonkey script, paste the content of gee_monkey.js into the script, then F5 refresh GEE.

Hope it works for you!
Welcome to improve this little script.
